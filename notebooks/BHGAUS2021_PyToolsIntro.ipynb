    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "Before you run through this notebook, make sure you've completed the following steps:\n",
    "- Installed conda or miniconda\n",
    "- Created a conda environment from the \"environment.yaml\" file in the repository. To do this, run the following command in your terminal: `conda create -n simplesig python=3.8 numpy ipykernel`\n",
    "- Made sure that the kernel for this notebook is the python installed in your new environment (\"simplesig\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Welcome to the Brainhack Global Australasia 2021 Python workshop! Over the course of this workshop, you'll learn how to create functional python-based analysis tools. We'll run through the following steps:\n",
    "- Write python code to:\n",
    "    - Generate a simple artificial signal\n",
    "    - Run some simple frequency decomposition analyses on this signal\n",
    "    - Plot the results with [holoviews](https://holoviews.org/getting_started/index.html)\n",
    "- Implement your newly written code in functions\n",
    "- Compile these functions into a pip-installable module\n",
    "- Compile these functions into a command-line script\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Import modules\n",
    "Over the course of this tutorial, you'll have to load in a number of python \"modules\" to run the code. These are scripts that other people have written and made available for us to use, so that we don't have to write everything from scratch! By creating the conda environment at the begining of the session, we downloaded these scripts and are now able to use them in this script as long as we \"import\" the module that they are stored under. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's good practice to keep all of these imports in the same place, so as you need to add each new module in the tutorial, make sure you add the call to import them in the cell below. \n",

In this tutorial we'll be running frequency decomposition analyses. We'll therefore begin by generating an artificial signal with a number of different frequency-specific signals embedded at different times without the signal. By doing this, we can evaluate how well different algorithms are able to extract this information from our signal. \n",
